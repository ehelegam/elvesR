## elvesR: personalized R functions

Dealing with genomic data required tools and fortunately they are becoming more and more available. However specificity of a given model system requires personalized tools. For example knowing in each gene a given position falls in crutial to make decisions. The best way of knowing that is to use, as an exemple genome browser such [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/) or [NCBI webpage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). This simple task can be time-consuming and hard if internet conexion are not available.

In this R package I created functions to run the most frequent task done during my PhD at Luis' lab ([Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia](http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/lteixeira)). They include analysing qPCR data (in duplicates or triplicates), simulating *Wolbachia* bottleneck in a single fly, converting phred quality score to error probability, converting linking positions to *Wolbachia* gene and finaly plotting points and median bar (equavalent to those of GraphPad).
